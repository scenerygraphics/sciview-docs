## Pre-workshop instructions

**Getting Fiji**

1. Follow the [Fiji installation instructions](../installation/installing-fiji.md), if it is not already installed.
2. Install the sciview update site using [these instructions](../installation/installing-the-development-sciview-plugin-for-fiji.md)

**Running sciview through python (linux only)**

1. Download
https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ob3gqmzstkgiww/Fiji.app-hip-summer-school-2021.zip?dl=0
2. Unzip the contents and go to that location in your terminal
3. In your terminal: `conda env create -f sciview.yml`
4. In your terminal: `conda activate sciview`
5. In your terminal: `python sciview.py`

**Getting the data**

* scripts used in the workshop can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ida-mdc/sciview-hip-2021) - if you don't want to use git, you can just click the green **Code** button, and click **Download ZIP**
* data for the 3D segmentation demo can be downloaded
  [here](https://cremi.org/static/data/sample_A_20160501.hdf) from the
  [CREMI challenge](https://cremi.org). The security certificate on
 the CREMI site is currently expired. Here is a [temporary link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nwrcz0cai4f7v4m/sample_A_20160501.hdf?dl=0) to the
 same file.

**Developers**

* Please [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one. If you are proficient at git, then this is not necessary
* To follow along with the developer session, we strongly recommend [downloading IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). It will be difficult to provide support for any other development environment during the tutorial session.
