## Pre-workshop instructions

**Getting Fiji**

1. Follow the [Fiji installation instructions](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview/installation/installing-fiji), if it is not already installed.

2. Install the sciview update site using [these instructions](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview/installation/installing-the-sciview-plugin-for-fiji)

3. Getting required files for the tutorial **run this script** in Fiji. [TODO: setup this script that downloads all of the necessary files]

**Getting the data**

- scripts used in the workshop can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kephale/sciview-i2k/tree/main/scripts)
- data for the 3D segmentation demo can be downloaded [here](https://cremi.org/static/data/sample_A_20160501.hdf) from the [CREMI challenge](https://cremi.org)

**Developer session**

- Please [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one. If you are proficient at git, then this is not necessary
- To follow along with the developer session, we strongly [downloading IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). It will be difficult to provide support for any other development environment during the tutorial session.
