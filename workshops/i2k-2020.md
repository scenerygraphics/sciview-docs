## Pre-workshop instructions

**Getting Fiji**

Download our prepackaged Fiji [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yjorzgsl39u03g2/Fiji.app-sciview-i2k.zip?dl=0)

**Getting the data**

* scripts used in the workshop can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kephale/sciview-i2k/tree/main/scripts)
* data for the 3D segmentation demo can be downloaded [here](https://cremi.org/static/data/sample_A_20160501.hdf) from the [CREMI challenge](https://cremi.org)

**Developer session**

* Please [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one. If you are proficient at git, then this is not necessary
* To follow along with the developer session, we strongly recommend [downloading IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). It will be difficult to provide support for any other development environment during the tutorial session.
