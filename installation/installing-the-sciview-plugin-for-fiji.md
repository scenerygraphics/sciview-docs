Fiji will scan your installation, and if necessary, suggest updates. If any updates are required, please install them before proceeding. You might need to restart Fiji in the process.

If your installation is up-to-date, the updater will show you an empty window like this:

Should there be any pending updates, please click `Apply changes`, then repeat the steps up to here.

### 3. Activating the sciview Update Site

You can now click `Close`. In the updater window, you will now see a list of files that the updater will download in order to download and install sciview. Click the `Apply changes` button to do that. Fiji will now download all necessary files for sciview, which might take a little moment.

### 4. Restarting Fiji

After the updater has completed downloading, you will be prompted to restart Fiji. Please do so. If you do not restart Fiji now, you will most likely run into problems.
